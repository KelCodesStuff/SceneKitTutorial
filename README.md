*Remarks*:
- *Code is now updated to be Swift 5 compliant*
- *It's imortant to know that the code is not intented to learn Swift, but to understand learning game development concepts*
- *Therefore some things (like unwrapping optionals) are just here to make things simpler*

### The Game
This tutorial is a companion work I do parallel on the development of my next upcoming 3D Game which uses just SceneKit and it's written entirely with Swift 5.

### For who is this Tutorial?
It's not for the absolute beginner or novice, because I assume things like Swift notation, trigonometric know-how etc.
On the other hand you don't have to learn all at the begin. Like the terrain class **RBTerrain**.
You can use it just like it is and read the code later again when you have more know-how.
The most important is that you understand the principles.

### Introduction
It's important for me to start directly with a good and solid base which can be used for real games later.
So please don't create a project using the Xcode Project wizard but start directly with the Source on GitHub.
Also I don't want to build a step by step tutorial which shows each line, but always cover a chapter of the Game and introduce
a new component and show the how and why :)

**Important**:
*Feel free to use this code in every way you want, but please consider also
to give esomething back to the community.*

*I don't own the license rights for the assets used in this tutorials,
so before you use them for something else then self-learning, please check by yourself the license behind
or even better replace it with your own art. Thank you!*
